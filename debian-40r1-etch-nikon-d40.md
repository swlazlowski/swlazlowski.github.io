# Debian 4.0r1 (Etch) and Nikon D40

The description of the camera can be found here. Wikipedia article with some reviews and more information can be found here.

The **f-spot** didn’t see the camera, and I don’t use Picasa (huge, sluggish, based on Wine) so I decided to do it manually. Simply connected the USB cable, read the `dmesg` output, created a mount point (exactly like in USB memory sticks), and it worked. Some distros like Slackware might make it more difficult, but should fly nonetheless.

Samples of photos made by my girlfriend can be found here.
