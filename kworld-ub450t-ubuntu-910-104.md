# Kworld Pico USB TV Tuner – UB450‑t under Ubuntu 9.10 / Ubuntu 10.4 Beta2

- Does not work out of the box.
- Had to dismantle (photos to be uploaded).
- Chips observed: **OMNITUNE TUA 9001** and **Realtek RTL2832U DVB‑T**.
- Common how‑tos were not successful.
- Following a specific how‑to, it was recognized. Scans pick up some limited reception; need a proper antenna to verify.
